        The Importance of Outreach
      </h2>

      <p class="justify bodytext">
        Communicating with experts and professionals allows us to gain critical insights into the strengths and shortcomings of our design, and shapes the narrative of our project. 
        In short, it allows us to understand current problems with fruit packaging and protection, and ensure the relevance and need for Cellucoat as a solution. 
        Moreover, the connections and networks we develop through this process can be leveraged in entrepreneurial endeavours to help bring our solution to a wider market, and reduce fruit waste and plastic use at a greater scale.

              <span class="emphasis3">Amir Varamesh</span> is a PhD Candidate at the <span style="font-weight: bold;">University of Calgary</span> who works closely with nanocellulose, and whose research has explored the potential for natural cellulosic fibres in the development of sustainable emulsions. We spoke to Amir to better understand the technical feasibility of our project, and to gain insight into the potential properties of our proposed coating.
              <br><br>
              Aside from confirming the extensive potential uses of cellulose, our conversation with Amir yielded several key considerations. 
              First, he encouraged us to consider the universality of our coating: would the formula be tailored to a specific type of fruit? How might application methods differ? These considerations will be important as we expand the variety of test fruits for our product, and as we consider Cellucoat’s commercial applications. By narrowing our tests to a single fruit, we can optimise the coating and its commercial applications.
              Secondly, Amir advised us on the benefits of incorporating chitosan and citric acid into the coating, which confer antibacterial properties without compromising the mechanical properties or food safety of the product. This highlights a valuable future direction for further research and testing.
              Finally, our conversation with Amir guided our approaches for assessing the strength and durability of Cellucoat. In fact, he noted that many of the key tools used for these tests can be found at labs at the University of Calgary!

              <span class="emphasis3">Michaella Atienza</span> is a Plant Molecular Biology Technician at the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Global Institute for Food Security</span> (GIFS) who works with the Operations team and Root-Soil-Microbial Interactions. 
              Michaella and her coworkers provided us with critical insight into working with fruit waste in a wet lab, industry and consumer perspectives, and the overall feasibility of our project.
              <br><br>
              Our first point of feedback was to consider the toxicity effects of fruit waste. 
              Fruit waste produces ethanol and other alcohols that may kill our bacteria, and contamination with mold/fungi/bacteria will pose a serious issue. 
              This guided us to implement autoclaving as part of our purification procedure for extracting fruit juice and aqueous extracts for our BC growth media.
              <br><br>  
              Next, Michaella and her coworkers made us aware of industry demands and public perception caveats. 
              The biggest takeaway was that in industry, money is always the biggest motivator regardless if our product is environmentally friendly. 
              As well, younger generations would likely be receptive to using our product.
              <br><br>  
              The last piece of feedback we must consider is the overall feasibility of producing lysozyme in E. coli as a synthetic biology project. 
              Because alternative methods exist for immobilising lysozyme onto BC without a linker sequence, the need for our “synbio spin” would need to be justified. 
              In light of these shortcomings with using lysozyme, we have decided to pivot our project from an antimicrobial, edible BC coating, to a packaging product with exploration for production in E. coli.

        Where Do We Go From Here?
      </h2>

      <p class="justify bodytext">
        Although our original narrative focused on the applications of Cellucoat in the context of food security in remote Indigeous communities, several concerns about the sensitivity and need for this solution motivated a pivot to a more commercial approach. 
        <br><br>
        Moving forward, we are considering the applications of Cellucoat as a biodegradable, sustainable alternative for plastic fruit packaging. 
        The use of recycled fruit as a carbon source reduces the cost of BC production, and the goal of expressing BC in E. coli could reduce the substantial cost and production time of conventional bacteria producers. Together, these aims culminate in an attractive coating alternative for industrial application.
        <br><br>
        Apples represent the largest type of fruit export in Canada: in 2020 alone, $42 million CAD worth of apples were exported. 
        In light of their value and thin, vulnerable skin, these represent an ideal focus for Cellucoat.
        <br><br>
        To better understand the integration of Cellucoat in fruit processing, key stakeholders need to be addressed. British Columbia produces the highest volume of fruit, including apples. 
        As such, we plan to reach out to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Consolidated Fruit Packers</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Global Fruit</span>, two main apple suppliers, to gain feedback and insight on our project.
