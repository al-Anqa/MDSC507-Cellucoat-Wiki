        Modelling is a key subproject to help the development of our project. 
        Particularly with the narrative of optimizing efficient and quality BC production for industry applications, it is important to be able to find out what those optimal conditions are and how we could improve upon them.
        <br><br>

        This ties in strongly with the wetlab since it directly quantifies our efficiency of production, which is a main portion of our project, and will allow us (if successful) to move forward in our entrepreneurial pursuits. 
        Furthermore, in a very iterative process, drylab modelling would take information from the wetlab to determine the optimal condition or quantity of one of the involved variables (or use predictive modelling), such as substrate, pH, temperature, etc., and then inform the wetlab of that optimal result to move forward with it in further product development.

        Optimizing BC Production Conditions Through Modelling

        There are quite a few different models possible that are both present in the literature and performed by iGEM teams to accomplish this goal. 
        One in depth example of a modelling project we can modify and pursue as a subproject is by <span style="font-weight: bold;">JNFLS</span> in 2020.

        <li>Modeled the effect of the inoculum size (amount of microorganisms/cells in the fermentation medium) and fermentation time on bacterial cellulose yield from e. Coli</li>
        <li>Assumptions:<ul>
          <li>Bacteria growing in an otherwise ideal environment (assuming fixed variables):
            <ul><li>Growth temperature, humidity, and pH value</li></ul>
          </li>
          <li>Assume polynomial relationship between fermentation time and inoculum size</li>
          <li>Eventually, ignored constants of fitting equation since practically negligible</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>This model takes measured results from the wetlab of how the synthesis rate of BC is affected by the inoculation size using varying inoculation amounts ranging from 1-15% over 9 days.</li>
        <li>The data and constants required for this model would be mainly results taken from wetlab experiments</li>
        <li>The results from this experiment were then graphed and the results were fitted cubically to generate final equations illustrating the effect of inoculum size on how much BC is produced in a set amount of time</li>

            <li>Pertaining to our project, this can be applied since it works with optimizing conditions, however it does have certain flaws due to its assumptions and would be quite wetlab heavy in terms of work and monitoring since it relies on experimental results.</li>
